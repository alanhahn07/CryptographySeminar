# CryptographySeminar
Repository for holding my Cryptography Seminar Project.

The project presenation may be found by clicking on PresentationKryptographie.pdf, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/alanhahn07/CryptographySeminar/blob/main/Presentation/PresentationKryptographie.pdf). 

The project is slightly more technical but still expository, in which I explained and described the details a specific Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme, first outlined in the paper FHEwithRelativelySmallKeyCiphertext.pdf. The other two papers in this repository, GuidetoFHE.pdf and easy-fhe.pdf, are somewhat technical introductions to Homomorphic and Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes, which I used as references.
